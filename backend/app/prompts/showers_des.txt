You are given a JSON object describing a shower product with fields such as:
title, sku, category, breadcrumbs, main_color, description, features, warranty,
colors, wels_rating, flow_rate, pressure_rating, temperature_rating, manufacturer, etc.

Your task is to generate a clean, well-structured HTML product description.

### Rules for HTML Output (Showers Only)

1. Product Title
   - First line must show the full product name in uppercase:
     <p><strong>{Manufacturer} {Title} {Main Color}</strong></p>
   - If size/dimensions appear in title or description, include them (e.g., 250mm, 800mm).

2. Alternate Colors
   - If `colors` contains more than the main color, list them like:
     <p><strong>Also Available in: Brushed Nickel, Matte Black, Brushed Gold</strong></p>
   - Exclude the main color.
   - If no alternates → skip this section.

3. Product Features
   - Add <p><strong>Product Features:</strong></p> followed by <ul><li>…</li></ul>.
   - Include the following in order if available:
     1. “Designed in Australia” (bold, if present)
     2. Product Code (sku)
     3. Colour (main_color)
     4. Material (detect from features: Brass, Stainless Steel, etc.)
     5. Type (derived from title/category — see rules below)
     6. WELS Rating (from wels_rating)
     7. Flow Rate (from flow_rate)
     8. Pressure Rating (from pressure_rating)
     9. Temperature Rating (from temperature_rating)
     10. All unique description + features (deduplicated, concise)

   - Type detection rules (use exact match from title where possible):
     * "Twin Shower" → Shower System with Rail
     * "Rail Shower" → Shower on Rail
     * "Shower Arm and Rose" → Shower Arm and Rose
     * "Overhead Shower" → Overhead Shower
     * Else → Shower System

4. Warranty
   - If warranty exists, structure like:
     <p><strong>Warranty:</strong></p>
     <p><strong>Domestic Warranty</strong></p>
     <ul><li>…</li></ul>
     <p><strong>Commercial Warranty</strong></p>
     <ul><li>…</li></ul>
   - If only one warranty type is available → show only that.
   - If no warranty → skip section.

5. Marketing Paragraph
   - Conclude with a polished promotional paragraph:
     <p>Experience the Phoenix {Title} in {Main Color}, crafted with durability and elegance. 
     Also available in {Other Colors if present}, this {Type} delivers premium performance 
     with features such as {highlight key features concisely}. 
     Backed by {Warranty Summary}, it’s the perfect upgrade for any modern bathroom.</p>
   - Omit warranty or colors if missing in data.

6. Missing Data
   - If a field is missing, simply skip it.
   - Do not output placeholders or empty tags.

Output only valid HTML using <p>, <ul>, <li>, <strong>, <em>.
Do not add CSS classes, inline styles, or application-specific markup.
